## Project Overview

This project encapsulates all the content learnt at AiCore so far, including Python, GitHub, Pandas, SQL, and various other skills like calling APIs and using AWS for data retrieval. The aim of the project is to extract, clean, and upload data to an SQL database called sales_data using PostgreSQL pgAdmin. Subsequently, this data will be queried using SQL statements to derive insights and metrics relevant to typical project requirements.

## Project Structure
The project consists of several key components:

Data Extraction: Python scripts are employed to extract data from various sources, including APIs and external data files.

Data Cleaning: Pandas is utilized for data cleaning and transformation to ensure the data is in a suitable format for database upload.

Database Upload: The cleaned data is then uploaded to the PostgreSQL database, sales_data, using pgAdmin for seamless integration.

## Technologies Used
The project leverages a variety of technologies:

**Programming language**: Python

***`requests`***: Used for making HTTP requests and interacting with external APIs.

***`validators`***: Provides utilities for validating various data types, URLs, and email addresses.

***`pandas`***: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library, facilitating structured data handling.

***`sqlalchemy`***: A toolkit for SQL interaction and an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for database operations.

***`tabula`***: Enables data extraction from PDF documents.

***`boto3`***: The AWS SDK for Python, used for AWS service integration.

***`yaml`***: A library for working with YAML files.

***`re`***: Python's regular expression library for pattern matching and data extraction.

***`Pandas`***: Employed for data manipulation and cleaning tasks.

***`GitHub`***: Version control and collaboration via GitHub to manage project changes and updates.

***`PostgreSQL`*** and pgAdmin: Utilized for database management and SQL querying.

***`AWS`***: AWS services are used for data retrieval and storage, enhancing the project's scalability and flexibility.

## Challenges and Solutions

Throughout the project, challenges such as data integrity and API integration were encountered. By applying the skills learned at AiCore, these challenges were addressed through rigorous data validation techniques and API authentication methodologies, ensuring the integrity and security of the extracted data.

## Expected Output

The project aims to derive various metrics and insights from the sales_data database through SQL querying. Examples of these insights include sales trends, customer behavior analysis, and inventory management indicators. Specific SQL queries will be formulated to extract these metrics, providing valuable business intelligence.
